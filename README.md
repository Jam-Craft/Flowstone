Flowstone Mod (1.7.2)
======================
In this mod, you shall find in chests a special item. 
This item shall change your life, or destroy it.
It is, the Flowstone Mixture, a new drink.
You may drink it but be warned, 
it can either do great things, or do bad things, 
to both you and the environment/players around you.
Or, it could just refill your hunger :P.

Unstable Flowstone Mixtures will most likely harm you.
Energized Flowstone Mixtures will always be beneficial.
Explosive Mixtures are self-explanatory.
Mystery Flowstone Mixtures are mysterious.

Flowstone extractors can be used on creepers to get explosive flowstone,
if you have glass bottles in your inventory.
